## Useful Shell

During the project I realized the need for some shell scripts that make the life of 42 student easier with this project.

- [ ] 1. **proto.sh**<br>This script updates the Makefile and libft.h header with the correct prototypes. Make sure you **READ** the instructions in the file before using the script.

- [ ] 2. **new_file.sh**<br>Run and see what happens. Make sure you **READ** the instructions.

- [ ] 3. **norm_cleaner.sh**<br>This script will clean some of your .c file's formatting errors. **NOTE!** It's not perfect, but occasionally saves time.

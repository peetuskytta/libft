# libft

The first real project at Hive Helsinki is to create a static library containing useful functions, some of which were already recoded during the Basecamp (Piscine). This project is a fantastic way to take a look at how things are done under the hood as you are expected to recode basic functions that you'd otherwise use via dynamic library.

## Status

- ✅ Graded on 12/30/2021
- ✅ Score: **100**
- ✅ Retry: **1** after two peer evaluations. Found edge cases for ft_strjoin.c and memory leaks in ft_strsplit.c for which I gave up and retried.

## Useful Shell

I recommend to check these shell scripts as they might be useful for anyone doing this project.

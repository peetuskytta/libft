# libft

The first real project at Hive Helsinki is to create a static library containing useful functions, some of which were already recoded during the Basecamp (Piscine). This project is a fantastic way to take a look at how things are done under the hood as you are expected to recode basic functions that you'd otherwise use via dynamic library.

## Status

- ✅ Graded on 12/30/2021
- ✅ Score: **100**
- ✅ Retry: **1** after two peer evaluations.

## Useful Shell

During the project I realized the need for some shell scripts that make the life of 42 student easier with this project.

- [x] 1. **proto.sh**<br>This script updates the Makefile and the .h headerfile with the correct prototypes. Make sure you **READ** the instructions in the file before using the script.

- [x] 2. **new_file.sh**<br>Run and see what happens. Make sure you **READ** the instructions.

- [x] 3. **norm_cleaner.sh**<br>This script will clean some of your .c file's formatting errors. In the image below you see a minor mistake being corrected using the script. It is best used when you have several formatting realated errors. **NOTE!** It's not perfect, but occasionally saves time. Doesn't correct variable declaration space/tab issues (yet).<br>

- [x] 4. **basic_checks.sh**<br>This script does a very basic and quick check of the files in your Libft project.<br>
  Features to be added:
  - [ ] author file login check<br>
  - [ ] Makefile rule tester<br>

> Below you can see what it looks like when errors are found.

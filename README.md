# libft

The first real project at Hive Helsinki is to create a static library containing useful functions, some of which were already recoded during the Basecamp (Piscine). This project is a fantastic way to take a look at how things are done under the hood as you are expected to recode basic functions that you'd otherwise use via dynamic library.
